RiftOnThePi
===========

A simple Oculus Rift test application targeted at the Raspberry Pi.
The goal is to evaluate how the Raspberry Pi performs with the Rift and if it can handle it.
Rendering is done using OpenGL ES 2.0. 
Accessing the Oculus Rift API is done through the Oculus SDK with a minor fix for the Pi.
